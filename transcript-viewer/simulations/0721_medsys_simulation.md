# VA Consultation O721 with MedSys AI Simulation

This document simulates how the VA transcript O721 consultation might occur with the proposed MedSys AI ambient listening system with dual displays - one shared between doctor and patient, and one private for the doctor.

## Initial Setup

*[Patient (with wife) enters exam room with doctor. Two displays are visible - one large screen visible to all parties, and a smaller screen angled toward only the doctor. The MedSys system is actively recording.]*

---

### DOCTOR:
Hello, Mr. [Patient]. Nice to meet you. I see you're here with your wife today?

### PATIENT:
Yes, this is my wife.

### DOCTOR:
Good to meet you both. Before we start, I want to let you know that our MedSys system is recording our conversation to help with note-taking. You can see on this screen here [gestures to shared display] what's being captured. MedSys, please show us the patient's current vitals and medications.

### [SHARED DISPLAY SHOWS]:

- Progressive decline with significant weight loss
- Recent pain control issues - inadequate relief with current regimen
- Oncology last seen: August, deemed not candidate for chemo/radiation
- Patient has upcoming Oncology appointment on Thursday

ALERT: Calcium levels were abnormal during last admission
ALERT: Pain management appears suboptimal based on last note
```

### DOCTOR:
I see you were in the hospital with us in December through early January. How have you been feeling since then?

### PATIENT:
I've been having a lot of pain, mostly in my abdomen.

### DOCTOR:
Can you show me where the pain is?

*[Patient indicates left lower abdomen area]*

### DOCTOR:
MedSys, note the patient is indicating left lower quadrant abdominal pain.

### [SHARED DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
CURRENT VISIT - KEY POINTS:
- Patient reports abdominal pain in left lower quadrant
- Pain not adequately controlled with current medications
- Pain described as constant with periods of increased intensity
```

### WIFE:
He's been on Dilaudid every two hours, but it only seems to help for about 45 minutes. He's also using the Fentanyl patch, but his pain is still not controlled.

### DOCTOR:
*[After examining patient]* I can feel a protrusion there. It appears to be a hernia. MedSys, add probable abdominal wall hernia to the assessment.

### [SHARED DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
ASSESSMENT:
- Probable abdominal wall hernia causing left lower quadrant pain
- Stage IV lung cancer (ongoing hospice care)
- Pain management needs adjustment
```

### [DOCTOR'S PRIVATE DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
ASSESSMENT:
- Abdominal wall hernia, likely incisional from previous bowel surgery
- Low surgical candidacy due to advanced cancer state
- Pain management: Consider increasing Fentanyl patch to 100mcg/72hrs
- Consider changing Dilaudid to q1h instead of q2h
- Need to coordinate with Hospice provider regarding medication changes
```

### DOCTOR:
MedSys, what were the patient's electrolyte levels during his last admission?

### [DOCTOR'S PRIVATE DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
LAB RESULTS (December admission):
- Calcium: 11.2 mg/dL (High)
- Phosphorus: 2.1 mg/dL (Low)
- Potassium: 3.3 mEq/L (Low)
- Magnesium: WNL
```

### DOCTOR:
I think we should check your electrolyte levels today. MedSys, please prepare lab orders for comprehensive metabolic panel.

### [SHARED DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
PLANNED ORDERS:
- Blood work to check electrolyte levels (comprehensive metabolic panel)
```

### WIFE:
He's also been coughing up some green sputum recently, which is new.

### [SHARED DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
NEW SYMPTOMS:
- Green productive cough (new)
```

### DOCTOR:
Thank you for mentioning that. MedSys, note that this is likely related to his underlying lung cancer.

### [SHARED DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
ASSESSMENT (updated):
- Probable abdominal wall hernia causing left lower quadrant pain
- Stage IV lung cancer with possible progression (new productive cough)
- Pain management needs adjustment
```

### DOCTOR:
Let's discuss the plan for your pain management. MedSys, contact the pharmacy to see if we can modify the Dilaudid prescription to every 1 hour instead of every 2 hours.

### [SHARED DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
TREATMENT PLAN:
- Check electrolyte levels today
- Adjust pain medication: Consider Dilaudid every 1 hour instead of 2
- Discuss potential Fentanyl patch dose increase with Hospice
- Follow up with Oncology on Thursday as scheduled
```

*[Doctor and patient review the displayed information]*

### PATIENT:
Can we also get the Lidoderm patches? We're almost out.

### DOCTOR:
MedSys, is Lidoderm patch on our formulary?

### [DOCTOR'S PRIVATE DISPLAY SHOWS]:
```
FORMULARY ALERT: Lidoderm (lidocaine) patch is non-formulary. 
Requires special approval. Alternatives: None suitable for topical pain relief.
```

### DOCTOR:
I see it's not on our regular medication list. MedSys, please note that we need to request a special approval for Lidoderm patches and also check on the nicotine patches the patient has been using.

### [SHARED DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
TREATMENT PLAN (updated):
- Check electrolyte levels today
- Adjust pain medication: Dilaudid every 1 hour instead of 2
- Discuss potential Fentanyl patch dose increase with Hospice
- Request special approval for Lidoderm patches
- Request nicotine patches
- Follow up with Oncology on Thursday as scheduled
```

### WIFE:
*[Reviews shared screen]* I notice it doesn't mention his anxiety medications. He needs both the Ativan and Zyprexa to manage his anxiety.

### DOCTOR:
Thank you for catching that. MedSys, please add to the treatment plan that the patient should continue both Ativan as needed for anxiety and scheduled Zyprexa.

### [SHARED DISPLAY UPDATES]:
```
MEDICATION PLAN:
- Continue Ativan as needed for anxiety
- Continue scheduled Zyprexa
- (Other medication adjustments as noted above)
```

## Benefits of MedSys System in This Consultation

1. **Documentation Transparency**: The patient and wife can see what's being recorded in real-time, allowing them to correct or add information (as the wife did with anxiety medications).

2. **Terminology Translation**: The system displays patient-friendly language on the shared screen while using more clinical terminology on the doctor's private screen.

3. **Efficiency**: The doctor can quickly retrieve historical information and lab values without searching through charts.

4. **Reduced Distractions**: Instead of typing notes, the doctor remains engaged with the patient while occasionally directing the AI system.

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: The system captures details like symptom descriptions that might otherwise be lost in manual note-taking.

6. **Error Prevention**: The shared display allows immediate verification of what's being recorded, reducing the chance of misunderstandings.

7. **Coordination of Care**: The system's awareness of the hospice provider and upcoming oncology appointment helps coordinate care across multiple providers.

8. **Medication Management**: The system helps identify formulary restrictions and necessary special approvals in real-time.

## Key Differences from Original Consultation

1. In the original transcript, considerable time was spent clarifying medication history and communication issues between VA and Hospice providers. The MedSys system would have this information readily available.

2. The patient's wife spent significant effort in the original consultation trying to ensure her husband's pain management needs were understood. With MedSys, these concerns would be visibly documented on the shared screen.

3. The doctors in the original consultation had to leave multiple times to look up information or consult with others. MedSys would provide this information instantly.

4. The hernia diagnosis was made but explaining surgical vs. non-surgical options took significant time. MedSys would help present this information more clearly while allowing the doctor to focus on the patient's concerns.

5. The confusion about medication approvals and pharmacy processes would be more transparent with MedSys, with clearer expectations about what can be provided immediately vs. what requires special approval.
