DOCTOR day2_consultation03
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
OK, fine. Alright. Um,

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
So, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, what I think , go on.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
I mean, there was just like, there was one thing I think just, 'cause I can panic and you can look online, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> get a bit, frantic.

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

PATIENT day2_consultation03
, I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that, you know, will need to be sorted and.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
Obviously, really, anything can just make you really frantic <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Hopefully nothing , so serious I will die from it, I don't know I just, I think got myself in a pickle.

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
OK.  so um, uh, obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via the video, uh, portal.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
Mmm.

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
 um, from what you've told me, this doesn't seem to be you know, anything um, that you're gonna die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
OK.

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
OK? I ,would like you to come to one of my clinics. I would like a GP to assess you. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> what you're, what you're describing might be something called Bell's Palsy. OK? Um,

PATIENT day2_consultation03
OK.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
Yeah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
We can go into that, explaining what that is, if um, if that's confirmed on, on physical examination. But um, that's not usually a  life-threatening problem.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
OK.

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
But, um, part of the reason why I'd like you to come in, it's just that we can do a, a what we call a, a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on, and confirm  that might be the diagnosis. Have a look, have a look inside the ear, see if there's any, , anything to see within the ear.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
OK.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
So, um, um, so, in answer to your question. No, I don't think that you need to worry about that, I ,  think you know , preliminarily I can, I can reassure you.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
OK.

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
However, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, in order to definitively reassure you, I, I think you need a physical examination today, OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, so what I wanna do, is I'm gonna send a message to our admin team, I'll ask them, to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
Mm-hmm.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
Yeah, that's fine.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
OK.

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
Um, within Central London. OK, and then you can ring the , the support team number, I'll leave that number in your notes. And you can ring them after five minutes, and then they'll slot you in to a place that's convenient for you, OK.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
OK.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
Yeah.

PATIENT day2_consultation03
, that's fine.

DOCTOR day2_consultation03
All right. So, someone <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> will see you, and hopefully you will be able to reassure further but, please make sure the appointment gets done today.
