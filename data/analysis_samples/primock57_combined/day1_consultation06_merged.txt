PATIENT day1_consultation06
I don't drink alcohol.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir?

PATIENT day1_consultation06
Uh, I try and walk to the shops, at least once a day.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
OK.

PATIENT day1_consultation06
Um, but uh, that's about it, I've. Yeah, I don't, I don't go running like I used to when i was young.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
OK.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Right, OK. And certainly now your symptoms, you, you're, you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the  uh, to the shop, she said.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Um, right. Ohh um, based on your, based on you history, and having listened to your story, I, I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure, sir. Um,

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Which can sometimes happen. Um, um, and uh,

PATIENT day1_consultation06
Mmm.

PATIENT day1_consultation06
That.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
It's . So, it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. Um, and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously

PATIENT day1_consultation06
What's going on.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Um, that's the first thing that comes to my mind. Um, now there's a couple of options <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> move forward. Um,

PATIENT day1_consultation06
Mmm.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Given that you're otherwise well at the moment, and having examined you, your chest, and your saturations and blood pressure are all OK,

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
I'm quite happy to increase your dose of Furosemide. Maybe, rather than one tablet a day, we can do two tablets a day, for the first few days.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Um, and see, and see how you're getting on.

PATIENT day1_consultation06
OK. If you think that'll be better.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Uh,

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
I think, I think, it's,  it's, it's definitely worth treating your symptoms. But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test, and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart, to see how well your heart's pumping.

PATIENT day1_consultation06
OK.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Is that something you've had before? Yeah, so um, an , it's a, it's a general scan of your heart. You might have had this done before, when you were diagnosed. And it's just to get a good

PATIENT day1_consultation06
What does that?

PATIENT day1_consultation06
Ohh yes, I remember now.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Sorry?

PATIENT day1_consultation06
Uh, yeah, I remember now. .

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
You remember that. OK, fine. That's something I can organize for you today. And, and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized. But, I think certainly in the meantime, let's, um,

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Let's, let's get a blood test done. We can check your um, you know your full blood count, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Um, and we can definitely increase your um, your Furosemide, uh, to you know, one tablet twice a day.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
But I really like, would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, see how you're getting on. That sound reasonable?

PATIENT day1_consultation06
I think that sounds like a good plan.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
And of course, in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, feel like you're getting more breathless, or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain, or palpitations or dizziness, then, uh, you know  I want you to give me a call sooner than that, and we can have a chat on the phone as well.

PATIENT day1_consultation06
OK. I'll see how I get on.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
OK? Do you have any questions for me?

PATIENT day1_consultation06
Uh, I think that's all pretty clear. Thank you very much Doctor.

DOCTOR day1_consultation06
Great, and then well I wish you all the best! Have a good day. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. Thank you.

PATIENT day1_consultation06
OK. See you soon.
