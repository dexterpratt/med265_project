PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah, sure. Um, my name is John Doe. Um, and I am twenty seven years old.

Um, so, I was born in nineteen ninety one, um, seventeenth of November.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
That's perfect, thank you for that. Are you, um, John, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, perfect, thank you for that. OK. So, tell me what the problem is. You've been having some difficulty breathing. Is that correct?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
, yeah, exactly. I've, I'm , kind of struggling to breathe at the moment. I, I got stung by a wasp, um, recently.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Well, I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Um, but I, uh, I'm feeling like slightly anxious that, uh, there's a bit of, I've got a bit of a, a rash on my arm where, i got stung.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Um, and, I've, kind of. But yeah, as I say, I've got this difficulty breathing and potentially, um, there's a bit of swelling in my lips. My tongue feels a bit weird.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Right, OK. So, when did this bee sting or bee bite occur?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Um, it was, just a few minutes ago.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Right, OK. Um, and, your, your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but, do they, which. Can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah, it's just kind of on the right-hand side. Um, and it, and it's just a bit sore, maybe it hasn't kind of , fully swollen up yet.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Sure.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Sure, OK. Uh, you said you've been having some difficulty breathing.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Your breathing seems all right to me right now. Um, the reason why I'm, clarifying is, because we have to decide whether this is a, an acute emergency. Whether I need to send you in to hospital straight away.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Or whether we, more time to ask questions, OK. So um, , do you feel like you've got difficulty breathing right now, this minute, as we speak?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Right.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
I, I, I , I don't, feel like it's , like particularly acute, but i'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse. I don't, I just wanted to speak to someone.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Sure, sure. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Sure. No you, uh, you did the right thing and I, and I can understand it , it is quite anxiety provoking, OK. All right. Can I just double-check? Before we carry on asking other questions. Have you got  history of anaphylaxis?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Uh, not that I know of.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
No, OK. Have you ever been given an EpiPen?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Uh, I haven't no.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
No, OK, all right.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Let, let's, um, take a step back now. So, in terms of the bee sting, it was a . Did you see a bee or you're, you're just , um, assuming it was a bee?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Um, I, , I, I find it difficult to tell the difference between a bee and a wasp, but um, , yeah it was one of the two.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
. One of the two.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
, OK. And, um, the area of your body that it stung. Where was it? Did you say it was your arm?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah, it was on my arm.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
All right. And you've got a rash there. Can I have a look?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Uh, yeah sure. Um, it's just, just there.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
OK, all right. That looks OK to me right now. , does it look red to you at the moment?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Mm-hmm.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
It's, it's slightly red, yeah and, and kind of there's, a bit of a, like a hole there, where I think that the wasp, stung me.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The puncture mark, yeah, OK, all right. Um, now, is, is there any swelling, around that area, that you can see? I, I couldn't see any.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Uh, .

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Not particularly. I, I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy, uh, and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like, particularly swollen. Um.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Sure. OK, all right.Um, now, have you taken any medication? It's probably a , you probably haven't, 'cause it was a few minutes ago. But have you? Is . , not taken , any , antihistamines or anything like that?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

PATIENT day2_consultation06

DOCTOR day2_consultation06

<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, that's kind of the, the major thing, nothing, nothing really.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06

DOCTOR day2_consultation06

Um, can I ask? Do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks, or anything like that?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Uh, yeah, uh, sometimes, occasionally.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Right, OK. Have you ever been on medication for that?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Um, no.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
OK.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
No.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Um, great. Now, um, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just, it's for, for general information purposes.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
So, um, , are you working at the moment?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yes.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
What do you work as?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Uh, I am a, uh, computer scientist.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
OK. And, um, , you living alone?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yes.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
OK. Do you have any pets at home?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Um, I have a cat, at home.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
A cat. OK, great.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
What I'd like to do now. If that's OK John? Is, I'd like to have a look inside your mouth, OK.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Um, one of the things that, um, we'd be worried about if, someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction. Is to see whether there's any swelling, of the lips, or the tissues inside the mouth, or the.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yep.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Soft tissues of the airway. And, um, I can, I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can, bring your device closer to your mouth, and then put your head back, mouth open wide. Sit somewhere where there's good lighting. And I just wanna have a look inside the throat, if that's OK?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Perfect, OK, great. Now, um, um, can, can I just get you to do it again? And, just say ah, this time.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yup.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Ah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
OK, fantastic, brilliant. OK. Um.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Uh, John. Based on, um, how you look. How you're talking to me, and how you're breathing, and the appearance, and your wrist.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Um, I don't feel that you're having , a, an, an, a life-threatening, uh, allergic reaction.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Now it's very normal, to have, a rash, when you have some kind of insect bite. It's uh, it's a localised, um, uh, inflammatory reaction, that um, is normal and that , immediate reaction, that redness, and that maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
What we're worried about, is when someone has, um, compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned, breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip. Thankfully I can't see any of that right now.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Right.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
, but that's, the most, urgent and most pressing thing that we'd be watching out for.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Given that it hasn't happened, initially, it's unlikely to happen later. OK we, so we have like a , stage one and stage two reaction, for these types of bites.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
And, usually if you're gonna have the reaction, it will happen straight away.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
So, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, we may be coming out of the danger zone now, it's um. But I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are, in case it happens. So for example.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
You would have, swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing. You might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that you, when you're trying, trying to breathe. It makes like a rasping sound, like this. OK. .

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Thankfully, you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates. Either make an appointment with us, or go straight to A and E.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Um, uh, and in some cases, if it's, if it's, uh, progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A and E, rather than to, wait for a booked appointment with us, OK.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
What I'd like you to do now, is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
So you can buy them over the counter. You can get Piriton or Chlorphenamine, and you can take one tablet, four milligrams, um, up to about six times a day. OK.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Or you can just take a one-a-day one, whichever is your preference, that's, that's absolutely fine, there's no, no issue. That should be enough to control this.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Um, if, the redness in your arm spreads, and you, it feels hot, or you, you know, you have signs of any localised infection.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
We may need to think about other treatments, like an antibiotic.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
And like I said if anything deteriorates, in terms of your breathing, that's urgent and we need to process that, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, action needs to be taken urgently.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Did you have any other, um, queries or was there anything else that you're worried about?

PATIENT day2_consultation06
OK.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Uh, no, I think, I think that kind of, that makes me feel a bit better. I guess, can I get that um, can I get the, uh, so the antihistamine from any shop, or like does it <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> pharmacy?

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Yeah, that's, that's over the, yeah , over the counter. You don't need to, any chemist, will have it, you don't need a prescription for that. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually, than to get it via prescription.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
OK. Um, now, um, uh, on the basis of what you've told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a , a straightforward localised reaction to a, an insect bite.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
OK.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
However, if it was to happen that, you know, this, you're, you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other, , non-specific rashes. We might need to think about blood testing, I don't think we're at, at that moment yet. OK.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
So uh, but , that's something to bear in mind in case this, becomes a recurrent pattern.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
OK.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
OK.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
OK then, so, we'll leave it like that for now, OK. I'm gonna leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions, just for you to read about it. I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware what  symptoms are.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Great.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Yeah.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
If those kind of things happen, get back to us.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
If you're feeling worried, just have a lower threshold for , having a chat with us, sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
OK, great. Yeah, that makes sense.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
All right then John, OK. Uh, well we'll leave it like that, , come back to us if you have any further issues.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>

PATIENT day2_consultation06
OK. Thanks. I appreciate your time.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
My pleasure. All right, take care then. All the best.

PATIENT day2_consultation06
Bye bye, bye.

DOCTOR day2_consultation06
Bye bye.
